This Dapp is for the Defi Exchange based loosely on Uniswap v1 that supports liquidity provision and swapping functionality of crypto dev token and eth.

Created as part of the [Learn Web3 DAO](https://www.learnweb3.io/) Sophmore Tack.

This code was written for Defi Exchange Tutorial

## Features

- Build an exhange with only one asset pair (Eth / Crypto Dev)
- Your Decentralized Exchange should take a fees of 1% on swaps
- When user adds liquidity, they should be given Crypto Dev LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens)
- CD LP tokens should be given propotional to the Ether user is willing to add to the liquidity

Let's start building ðŸš€

## Frontend 

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Overview Info

- Chain: Ethereum
- Network: Rinkeby
- Languages: Solidity, JavaScript
- Deployed to Rinkeby Exchange Contract: `0x0284101e315222b82A45a0c788A773d4628b2371`
- Rinkeby Contract Link on Etherscan: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0284101e315222b82A45a0c788A773d4628b2371

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
